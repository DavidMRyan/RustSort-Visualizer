# RustSort-Visualizer
![](https://i.imgur.com/6fDRqhC.png)

## Description
A simple sorting algorithm visualizer written in Rust. This project was a short-term project idea I had to help me learn the Rust language. I plan on adding more sorting algorithms as time goes on to further my understanding of the Rust language and sorting algorithms as a whole!
